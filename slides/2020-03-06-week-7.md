### Free Will

* What is it?

* Why should we care?

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Free Will - What is it?

* In technical terms, a person has free will if they are a _causal agent_.
* In other words, you have free will if you can:
  * Set your own ends,
  * Bring about (produce) those ends, and
  * Be responsible for the consequences of bringing about those ends

### Free Will Activity 1

Take a few minutes to write a short paragraph answering these questions:

* Do you think it's true that Daisy's leg wouldn't be broken if just one thing that day had changed?
* Does the narrator's conclusion that we don't have free will actually follow from his premises?

</section>

### Free Will Activity 2

As a group, we'll create a causal chain.

* Person 1 starts with a simple activity like "I got out of bed"
* Person 2 then follows up with an action they think would follow

Appropriate real-world actions only, please.

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Were your actions chosen freely, or determined by the actions listed before yours?

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Free Will Theories

* Determinism
* Compatibalism
* Libertarianism

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Which theory is right?

* If someone has no free will, can they be held responsible for what they do?
* If we are only sometimes causal agents, how do we tell when we are and are not responsible for our actions?
* If we are always causal agents, how do we make sense of clear examples of coercion?

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### What's at stake?

As we have seen, the question whether and to what extent we have free will is complicated. So why should we care?

Why does it matter in the real world, for real people, whether or not free will exists and to what extent we have it?
