### 5PP2 instructions

Given the unique situation we are all facing, the primary goal for the TAs for the rest of the semester is to focus on making sure that you are well-positioned to write your last two papers.

As such, I will provide slide decks that will be very detailed. These slides will be available online at my website for you to reference at any time during your writing process.

We will still make time for discussion activities, so keep up with your QCCRs!

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### 5PP2 Prompt

We discussed three different positions (Hard Determinism, Compatibilism, and Libertarianism) with respect to the problem of reconciling human freedom and moral responsibility.  Using the articles by D’Holbach, Ayer, and Chisholm, which position do you find most convincing and why do you think so?  In order to fully answer this question you will have to set up the problem of reconciling freewill and moral responsibility, and then give the main argument for the position you are defending.  Then you should consider any objections to that argument, and explain why you still think the position is persuasive.  That explanation might also include a discussion of the other two positions, your objections to them, and why these objections lead you to conclude that these positions are less convincing than the one you are defending.  

**Please be careful to address all parts of the question, and to give reasons in defense of your position.**

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### 5PP2 Breaking down the prompt

Your paper should have the following sections:

1. Introduction section
2. Section setting up the problem
3. Section explicating the view you like best
4. Section arguing why you think the view you explained is best
5. Section explaining objections to the view you like
6. Section explaining why the view you like best is still persuasive
7. Conclusion section

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 1: Introduction

Your Introduction should include 2 pieces:

1. Your thesis statement
2. A road map to your paper

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

Your Introduction should **not** include:

* Filler phrases. This means no:
  * "Catchy" opening sentence, poetry, or metaphor
  * These do not situate the paper as a rigorous academic paper
* "Context of discovery" references. This means no:
  * Descriptions of the order in which you thought things
  * What you were feeling when you thought them
  * Your current psychological state, or
  * Your speculation about how people might feel about your thoughts

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Your thesis statement should...

* Be the **very first** sentence of your paper
* Have the following sentence structure:

In this paper, I will argue that **[insert the name of the view you like]**, as presented by **[insert the name of the author of the view you like]**, is the most convincing solution to the problem of reconciling freewill and moral responsibility.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Your road map should...

* Tell your audience what they should expect as they read
* Literally, it looks like this:

To support my argument, I will first [do a]. Then, I will [do b]. I will also [do c], then [do d]. Finally, I will conclude by [doing e, where e is something like "providing a summary of my arguments," etc.]

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 2: Explain the Problem

* Briefly explain what freewill is. Consider questions like:
  * How does the author of the view you like define freewill?
  * How does his view compare to the other authors' definitions?
  * Refer to the text and use quotes!
* Briefly explain why it's hard to reconcile freewill with moral responsibility. Consider questions like:
  * What does it mean for moral responsibility if the Determinists are right? The Compatibilists? The Libertarians?
  * Refer to the text and use quotes! My slides from Mar. 6 and your lecture notes will also be helpful.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 3: Explain the View You Like

* Write a summary of the view you like
  * What is the structure of the argument the author makes? (schematization)
  * What are the main premises the author gives?
  * What is the conclusion the author comes to?

This is **not** the section to critically evaluate the view (e.g., provide your argument for why the view you like is the right view). That will be in the next section.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 4: Argue Why You Like That View

This is where you provide your argument for why you think the view you chose is the most persuasive. Consider questions like:

* What are the view's strengths and weaknesses?
* Are the view's weaknesses **critical** (e.g., weaknesses against which the view has no way to be defended)? If not, why not?
* Does the view have positive applications or implications in the real world?
* How does the view benefit society?
* How could the view influence policies made about moral responsibility? Is that influence beneficial or harmful and to whom might it be beneficial or harmful?

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Special Note

You are **not** required to answer all of (or only) the questions listed on the previous slide. However, these **are** the sorts of questions you need to answer for your argument to be persuasive. Remember that you want your audience to seriously consider your argument! You have to show them why they should do that.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 5: Explain Ways Someone Might Object

This section will be easy in this paper, because you have ready-made objections in the two views you don't consider most persuasive.

* If you like Determinism, how would the Compatibilists and Libertarians object to the Determinist view?
* If you like Compatibilism, how would the Determinists and Libertarians object to the Compatibilist view?
* If you like Libertarianism, how would the Compatibilists and Determinist object to the Libertarian view?

Your class notes, the readings, and my slides from Mar. 06 will be especially helpful here.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 6: Explain Why the View is Still Persuasive

In this section, you need to show why the objections that someone holding one of the other two views are not **critical** objections to the view you like best. Think of questions like:

* How would the author of my view respond to these objections?
* Do these objections call into serious question the truth or strength of the author's premises? If yes, how?
  * Also, if the objections weaken the premises, is there something you think the author could have said or corrected that would defend against the objections?
* Do these objections undermine the conclusion of the view in a serious way? Why or why not?

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Section 7: Conclusion

In your conclusion, simply wrap up the paper with a short summary of what you did. It will look like this:

I argued that **[your preferred view]** provided the most persuasive solution to the problem of reconciling freewill and moral responsibility. I first explained **[a brief summary of section 1]**. Then I **[summary of what you did in section 2]**. I then provided my own arguments critically evaluating **[your preferred view]**, showing that it is persuasive because of **[x, y, and z reasons]**. While **[people who hole the other views]** might object by **[brief summary of the objections you consider]**, I defended **[your view]** by showing how the view holds up against these objections. Namely, I showed that **[your view]** holds up against **[objection 1]** because **[brief description of your first defense]**. Moreover, **[your view]** can be defended against **[objection 2]** by **[brief description of your second defense]**.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

### Special note

You can (and should) use your own words for your conclusion. Unlike the thesis statement, which I want you to put in the exact form I gave on slide 10, you can structure your conclusion how you would like. I am only providing you a basic example structure of a conclusion to help you figure out how to structure your own.
