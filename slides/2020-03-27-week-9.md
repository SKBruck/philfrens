### Paper instructions

Given the unique situation we are all facing, I have gone through and created these slides to help you write your second 5 page paper.

These slides are broken up into sections that directly correlate to the grading rubric I'm required to use to grade you. They include:

1. Thesis Statement
2. Main Argument & Paper Structure
3. Objections & Replies
4. Grammar & Spelling
5. Follows Directions
