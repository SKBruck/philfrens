  ### Make Sure You've Fully Broken Down the Prompt

  Breaking down a prompt works like this:

  1. Read the prompt once **all the way through**
  2. Read the prompt a second time, and list out all the individual questions or
  tasks listed in the prompt.
  3. Each individual part of the prompt corresponds to a section of your paper

</section>

<section style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  <h3>Your Introduction Should:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>A clear thesis statement</li>
    <li>A brief map of your argument</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You do not need to include background information or summaries in the
    intro. Just tell me what you're arguing and how your paper will develop.</p>

</section>

<section style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  <h3>Your Introduction should <strong>not</strong> include:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Filler phrases. This means phrases like:
      <ul>
        <li>"Since the dawn of time, mankind has pondered the question of..."
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Other "catchy" opening sentences, poetry, metaphor, or unfalsifiable
      claims. These phrases undermine your pursuasiveness.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>"Context of discovery" references. This means no:
      <ul>
        <li>Descriptions of the order in which you thought things</li>
        <li>What you were feeling when you thought them</li>
        <li>Your current psychological state, or</li>
        <li>Your speculation about how people might feel about your thoughts
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  <h3>Your Thesis Statement Should:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Be <strong>clearly indicated</strong> by starting with "I argue..."</li>
    <li>Include what you are arguing (e.g., I argue that [Author] has the more
      plausible theory because...")</li>
    <li>Include your main philosophical reason for your argument</li>
  </ol>

  ### Road Map

  Don't forget to tell your readers exactly where your paper is going. First
  you're going to talk about [this topic]. Then [another topic]. etc.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  <h3>The Body of Your Paper Should:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Contain a brief summary of Cohen and Brennan's arguments</li>
    <li>Contain a concise description of at least one way that these two
      arguments contrast (e.g., Cohen uses ideal theory while Brennan believes
      he's using non-ideal theory, etc.)</li>
    <li>Explicate the argument you set forth in your thesis statement</li>
  </ul>

</section>

  ### Objections to Your Argument

  You are expected to respectfully entertain at least one **strong** objection
  to **your own** argument. That means you should briefly describe an issue
  someone might have with your argument, and then show how their concern does
  not actuall pose a threat to your argument.
