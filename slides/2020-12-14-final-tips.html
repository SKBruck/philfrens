<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  ### Make Your Document

  1. Write your paper in Word
  2. Check your formatting:
  1. 12 point black font (arial or calibri)
  2. 1 inch margins
  3. Double spaced
  4. Make sure AUTO SAVE options are turned on

  ### Make Sure You've Fully Broken Down the Prompt

  Breaking down a prompt works like this:

  1. Read the prompt once **all the way through**
  2. Read the prompt a second time, and list out all the individual questions or
  tasks listed in the prompt.
  3. Each individual part of the prompt corresponds to a section of your paper

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  ### Section 1: Introduction

  Your Introduction should include 2 parts:

  1. Your **clearly indicated** thesis statement
  2. A road map to your paper

  You do not need to include background information or summaries in the intro.
  Just tell me what you're arguing and how your paper will develop.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  ### Your Introduction should **not** include:

  * Filler phrases. This means phrases like:
  ** "Since the dawn of time, mankind has pondered the question of..."
  * Other "catchy" opening sentences, poetry, metaphor, or unfalsifiable claims
  ** These do not situate the paper as a rigorous academic paper
  * "Context of discovery" references. This means no:
  ** Descriptions of the order in which you thought things
  ** What you were feeling when you thought them
  ** Your current psychological state, or
  ** Your speculation about how people might feel about your thoughts

</section>

  ### Thesis Statement

  You're going to be writing your own thesis statements this time. Still, they
  should:

  * Be **CLEARLY INDICATED** with indicating phrases like "I will argue..." or
  "I argue that..."
  * Your thesis statement should include what you are arguing - you don't need
  to include any other info. It'll look something like "I argue that [Cohen or
  Brennan] has the more plausible view because [your reason]."

</section>

  ### Road Map

  Don't forget to tell your readers exactly where your paper is going. First
  you're going to talk about [this topic]. Then [another topic]. etc.

  [Check out the Week 9 Slides for a good example if you're not feeling
  confident about
  this.](http://www.philosofriends.com/slides/2020-03-27-week-9.html#/)

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  ### Body of the paper

  The body of your paper should include the following:

  * A **brief** summary of Cohen's argument, Brennan's argument, and at least
  one way that these arguments contrast with each other.
  * Your argument about whether you think Cohen's or Brennan's argument is more
  plausible. You should explain your **philosophical** reasons for your
  argument. If you're not sure that your reasons for you argument are
  philosophical, let me know asap.

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  ### Objections to Your Argument

  This section is standard. Even though it's not in the prompt, you are expected
  to explore at least one **strong** objection to **your** argument and then
  defend **your** argument against that objection. If you're struggling with
  this, email me and I can help you find a good objection or help you work out a
  defense.

  **That said,** this is not the most important section of your paper and
  shouldn't be more than one to one and a half pages (two to three paragraphs).

</section>

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">

  ### Conclusion

  In your conclusion, simply wrap up the paper with a short summary of what you
  did - just like with the last paper.

  [Check out the Week 9 Slides for a good example if you're not feeling
  confident about
  this.](http://www.philosofriends.com/slides/2020-03-27-week-9.html#/)

  This section of the paper should be no more than one half to three quarters of
  a page long.

  You may use outside resources for this paper, including information given on
  the prompt and from the website Shelley has linked.

  source, it probably isn't. The SEP, the IEP, and Wikipedia are **not**
  reputable sources for the purposes of this paper.

  can use MLA, APA, or Chicago (name-date) citations styles. **Carefully cite
