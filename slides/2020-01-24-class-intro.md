### My office and my classroom are safe and inclusive spaces

If you have a question or comment and you're not certain if it is offensive, discuss it with me in private and we will figure out a way to sensitively bring the topic into class discussion. It is important for us all to be able to uncover our biases and discover things about the world, but it's also important to do so in a manner that is not harmful to ourselves or each other.

Intentionally abusive language or behavior will not be tolerated. Refer to the [Student Code of Conduct](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/) for more information.
